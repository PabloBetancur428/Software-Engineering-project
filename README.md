The primary objective of this code was to develop a straightforward Graphical User Interface (GUI) capable of categorizing images of CT hemorrhages and normal CT scans of the brain. The GUI was constructed using Tkinter and TensorFlow, providing the ability to browse for images within any folder on the current PC. The pretrained model, accessible on GitHub (URL provided),incorporates multiple convolutional layers, alongside Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) components. After testing, the pretrained model achieved a commendable accuracy of 88.33%.
